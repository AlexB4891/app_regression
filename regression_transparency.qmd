## Event Study design (fixed effects model)

$$Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \sum_{i \neq 2014} \beta_i \times Time_{i} + \sum_{i \neq 2014} \beta_i \times Time_{i} \times Treatment_{it} + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{it}$$

Where:

-   $Y_{it}$ is `r params$var_lab`, the dependent variable for unit $i$ at time $t$.
-   $Time_{i}$ are dummy variables that are 1 if the year is $i$, and 0 otherwise. The year 2014 is the reference year and therefore does not appear in the equation.
-   $\beta_0$ is the intercept.
-   $\beta_i$ are the coefficients of the dummy variables for the years, which capture the effect of the year change on the dependent variable.
-   $\alpha_i$ is the fixed effect for unit $i$, which captures time-invariant characteristics of each unit.
-   $\epsilon_{it}$ is the error term.


**Dependent variable:** `r params$var_lab`
